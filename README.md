### Description
A simple work day calendar from 8AM to 5PM where a user can store what is on their calendar for that day. When the page is refreshed the item that is typed does not disappear. Throughout the day the color changes from green (future time) to red (current time) to grey (time that has past). The current date and time is at the top of the screen.
